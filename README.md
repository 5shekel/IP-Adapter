## Introduction

we present IP-Adapter, an effective and lightweight
adapter to achieve image prompt capability for the pretrained
text-to-image diffusion models. An IP-Adapter
with only 22M parameters can achieve comparable or even
better performance to a fine-tuned image prompt model. IPAdapter
can be generalized not only to other custom models
fine-tuned from the same base model, but also to controllable
generation using existing controllable tools. Moreover, the image prompt
can also work well with the text prompt to accomplish multimodal
image generation.
